# RescueX: AI-Powered Virtual Rescuer for Natural Disasters and Emergency Response


# Problem Statement:
Natural disasters like floods, earthquakes, landslides, and hurricanes create life-threatening situations where individuals often lack real-time guidance, evacuation support, and communication with rescue teams. On the other side, rescue teams require clear, accurate information about the local area and its environmental conditions to carry out life-saving operations effectively. Without personalized guidance and instant communication with authorities, people affected by disasters face delays in receiving help, heightening both risk and uncertainty. Real-time support is crucial in enabling fast, informed decision-making, ultimately improving the chances of survival.


# Solution Overview:
RescueX is an AI-driven virtual rescuer that helps individuals navigate natural disasters by providing real-time, personalized guidance based on their current situation. Using IBM Watsonx, the platform analyses user inputs (voice/text) along with real-time data on weather, terrain, and local hazards to provide evacuation plans and recommend the safest course of action to handle the situation. RescueX also ensures seamless communication with rescue teams, facilitating timely coordination. The system dynamically adapts to changing conditions, offering personalized emergency kit suggestions and streamlining rescue efforts, helping individuals make fast, informed decisions in critical moments. 


# Architecture Overview:



# Long Description:

RescueX, powered by IBM Watsonx, is an AI-driven virtual rescuer to improve emergency response processes in the context of natural disasters like floods, earthquakes etc. The solution addresses the challenges faced by individuals and rescue teams during life-threatening situations, where timely, precise information is critical to saving lives.
It would be beneficial for multiple sectors, like emergency management, public safety, and disaster management. By improving the flow of information during crises, RescueX can empower these professionals to make more informed decisions, ultimately saving lives and reducing the impact of disasters on communities.
# Features:
1. Built on IBM Watsonx technology, RescueX integrates advanced AI capabilities to process both user inputs (voice/ text).
2. Suggests the safest routes to handle the situation based on analyzing the current environmental conditions.
3. Provides the information of nearest safe shelter homes.
4. Personalized emergency kit recommendations.
5. Assesses the surrounding environment to guide rescue teams to the user's location during emergencies.

# Flow of the Actions: 

1. The User (general public) who is stuck in floods is using the RescueX app to describe his situation and ask for guidance (some kind of self-help) to guide him to Take necessary precaution and preparedness to protect him. 
2. Now based on the question asked, the Watson understands the situation faced by the user, analyses the current weather conditions of the geographical location of the user, thinks (with Reasoning and Acting framework approach), and provides tailored response to the user by acting as a virtual rescuer. Based on the real-time data and flood prediction model, the system can also generate: Emergency evacuation plans. Shelter and rescue center locations. Resources needed for the affected population (e.g., food, water, medical aid).
3. If the situation is critical, the watsonx bot also intimates the Nearby Rescue authorities and connecting them with the user. The Rescuer connects with the User and provides additional support by the time he reaches the affected area.
4. At the other side (Rescue Team) the RescueX analyzes the terrain, nearby water bodies, and current weather conditions around the user's location, using this data to suggest the safest and fastest routes for the team to reach the affected area. It provides real-time insights, such as road conditions, potential obstacles, and flood-prone zones, ensuring that the rescuers can navigate efficiently and reach the user with minimal delay.

# Sample Conversation :

User:  I’m in a heavy rainstorm, and it’s flooding. I’m with my elderly parents and our puppy. Can you help us figure out what to do?
RescueX: "Hello! I’m here to help you. Let me gather some details first:
    1. Your Location: You are in a heavy rainstorm, and I see flood alerts in your area.
    2. Companions: You're with elderly parents and a puppy.
Let me check the latest weather forecast and find the best plan for you…"
(After checking weather data)
"The rain is expected to worsen in the next two hours, with possible flash flooding. It’s important to stay prepared. Here are some suggestions based on your situation:
    1. For Your Elderly Parents: Ensure they have their medications, warm clothes, and a blanket handy. Move them to a higher floor if possible.
    2. For Your Puppy: Keep a pet carrier or leash ready. Make sure you have food, water, and a way to carry your pet if you need to move quickly.
    3. Have flashlights and torch batteries, a first aid kit, water, and non-perishable foods like biscuits, protein bars, breads, etc.
    4. Move to the upper floors if flooding begins.
    5. Switch off any electronic items on the ground and place them safely on shelves. 
    6. Close doors and windows, and block any gaps where water might enter.
Would you like me to help you find the nearest safe shelter?
User: Yes, that would be helpful?
RescueX: I’ve found the nearest emergency shelter that accepts both pets and provides elder care. It’s “Mathrubhoomi Foundation”, which is 2 miles away from your location, and you can take the southwest exit to avoid the flood-prone areas. 
User: What should I bring with me?
RescueX: I’ve alerted the local rescue team. They’ll be aware of your situation and can reach out if needed. Also, here is their contact number - 0000000038
For evacuation, here’s a personalized emergency kit recommendation:
    • For Your Parents: Medications, blanket, ID cards, and water.
    • For Your Puppy: Leash, food, water, and pet carrier.
    • For Everyone: Flashlight, first aid kit, some snacks, and important documents (keep these in a waterproof bag).
User: Thank you! That’s very helpful. We’ll stay ready and leave if needed.
RescueX: I’m glad I could help. Stay safe, and if anything changes or you need more assistance, just let me know!
